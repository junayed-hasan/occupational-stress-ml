## 🔍 Overview  

**Workplace stress** is a critical issue that impacts **employee well-being, organizational efficiency, and workplace safety**. This repository provides **cutting-edge AI solutions** for detecting, analyzing, and mitigating occupational stress using a combination of:  

✅ **Machine Learning (ML)** for stress detection models.  
✅ **Deep Learning (DL)** using advanced neural networks.  
✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to extract insights from survey data.  
✅ **Explainable AI (XAI)** for interpretability in workplace safety decisions.  
✅ **Synthetic Data Generation** to validate model generalizability.  

**Why does this matter?**  
- Stressed workers are **more prone to workplace accidents** and lower productivity.  
- Organizations spend billions annually on absenteeism and medical costs due to work-related stress.  
- Traditional stress assessments (e.g., surveys, self-reports) are slow, subjective, and lack predictive power.  

**Our AI-driven approach** automates stress detection, enhances workplace safety, and enables proactive decision-making for both **organizations** and **policymakers**.
